# Bare metal code examples for Allwinner's V3S SOC

These examples work without any operating system environment. It's like programming simple microcontrollers or "old school" programming techniques. Examples can be used for educational purposes to teach low-level programming. All programs can be run on [LicheePi Zero](https://linux-sunxi.org/LicheePi_Zero) demoboard.
